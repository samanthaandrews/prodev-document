		<h3>How I Use My Whole Brain</h3>
		<p>I use my whole brain when I am creating. Whether it be writing blog posts, writing code, or designing, I am
			hitting all four quadrants. Even when I am writing creatively I am using the logical and analytical side of my
			brain because I want the flow and pacing of the writing to make sense to the reader.</p>

		<p>Coding also feels like I am using my whole brain. I get to be creative with the design, but there are limits
			since I want users (other humans) to be able to use my code. This means my design has to be user-friendly and
			logical. In addition, writing code that others will be able to understand means I have to use the
			organizational quadrant of my brain.</p>

		<p>Graphic design was my introduction to using my whole brain. I found that when I was designing and working with
			clients, I was completely immersed in the task at hand. Losing track of time is a clue that points to
			whole-brain activities.</p>

		<h3>Golden Circle</h3>
		<div>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Why?</strong>
					I believe everyone is creative and that believing in your own creative potential is a powerful tool to
					living a happy, healthy, fulfilling life. I want to build stronger, more creative communities.
				</li>
				<li><strong>How?</strong>
					Coding
				</li>
				<li><strong>What?</strong>
					Building human-centered apps and websites. I want to improve people’s lives by improving the technology
					that they use.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
		<h4>Version 1</h4>
		<p>Hi my name is Sam. I seek to improve people’s lives by improving the technology that they use. I build
			human-centered apps and websites that help individuals be more creative, productive, and happy. I’m learning
			full stack web development with the CNM STEMulus Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp, which focuses on the LAMP stack.
			How are you working within the community?</p>
		<h4>Version 2</h4>
		<p>This is the second version of my elevator pitch.</p>
		<h3>When I Googled myself...</h3>
		<p>I found my LinkedIn profile at the top, cool! I also found a couple articles I've written for Thought Catalog
			and my Upwork freelancer page. My blog, TheMinimalistCreative.net was on the first page, and one of my popular
			Medium articles is on the second. Surprisingly I found an interview I did with ABQ ZineFest in 2015! I think
			all
			of these accurately depict my "brand" as a creative person in Albuquerque. Why is my high school cross country
			record on the second page!? That's kind of crazy. My "Creative Mornings" profile picture is the first image and
			there is an old blog post and image from 2012 when I was a student employee at PBS. I kind of wish that one
			would disappear...</p>
		<h3>How I Will Market Myself After The Bootcamp</h3>
		<h4>Direct</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Email Elisa from Lavu with my updated resume and ask for an internship</li>
			<li>Get in touch with Walker’s boss who owns Turquoise Skies (a jewelry company) and said I could work on his
				Wordpress website
			</li>
			<li>Contact JP Eaglin (we developer and community organizer) to partner on a project with him</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Indirect</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Attend the Coffee and Creatives meet up on Thursday evenings. Talk to at least two people I don't know and
				hand out my business card
			</li>
			<li>Post about web design and development on social media every once in a while.</li>
			<li>Participate in a code-a-thon</li>
			<li>Continue to write my blog</li>
			<li>Become involved in Girl Develop It or start a Girls Who Code Club</li>
			<li>Invest in a co-working space</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Organizations/People For Dan To Contact</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>JP Eaglin, Creative Director and Community organizer, <a href="http://worldwideunderground.com/">Worldwide Underground</a></li>
			<li>Erin E. Barrio, Communications Manager, <a href="http://vergefund.com/">Verge Fund</a></li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Worth Questions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>What are internal and external factors keeping you from achieving your goal?</strong>
				<p>Self doubt and imposter syndrome are internal factors that weigh me down sometimes. External factors
					include lack of time and experience actually programming.</p>
			</li>
			<li><strong>How do personally create value for others?</strong>
				<p>I always help with simple design projects when people ask for help. I think my writing creates value for
					others, and that's something I love to do. I love giving personal and professional advice to people who
					ask for it!</p>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Has anyone ever told you that you got potential professionally? Do you believe it?</strong>
				<p>I do believe I have potential professionally. In previous jobs, my supervisors have all liked me, but I
					felt limited by their lack of planning or organization. I often felt like I was taking things more
					seriously than anyone else, and that my success was limited by a supervisor's lack of support or
					inability to take responsibility for their mistakes. This makes it sound like I am blaming everyone else
					for my problems, but I do hope to one day find a supervisor who works as hard as I do and who inspires me
					to step outside my comfort zone. I want to learn how to be a great leader from a great leader.</p>
			</li>

		<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
		<h4>Week 1</h4>
		<p>I know I'm still very firmly in the honeymoon phase of this bootcamp, but I'm loving it thus far. I realize I
			am interested in both frontend and backend development. I seek to understand as much as possible about whatever
			we are learning and I like asking other students for help when I don't understand something. Everyone has their
			strengths and I appreciate being part of a team. I think the immersive, fast-paced environment fits my
			personality and learning style.</p>
		<h4>Week 2</h4>
		<p>This week has been more difficult than Week 1, mostly just because the material is more difficult to
			understand. It's hard to go to bed each night with a jumble of php syntax floating around my brain! I know that
			if I keep practicing and asking questions during class, it will eventually start to come together. I've found
			that for me, the first 50 hours of learning and doing something is the most frustrating. After that, it's still
			not easy, but at least the pieces make sense. In my personal life I've been having to say "no" a lot to friends
			who ask me to hang out. Even though everyone knows I'm in the bootcamp I don't think they fully understand the
			intensity! A year ago I would have felt guilty for saying "no," but at this point in my life I no longer feel
			that way.</p>
		<h4>Week 3</h4>
		<p>This week went by fast. I enjoyed the time we were able to code on our own because I felt myself getting lost
			in the work. This weekend I'm planning on reviewing my notes from this week and making sure I remember
			important concepts. All of the lecture was starting to get to me! I enjoyed getting coffee with Karen and Lisa
			Atkins, they both gave great advice about how to find a company with integrity to work for.</p>
		<p>This week I...</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Reached out to Walker at Turquoise Skies about completing a project with them post-bootcamp.</li>
			<li>Spoke with Monica Alvarez about getting involved with Girls Who Code and Girl Develop It. She is putting me in touch with Paul, the organizer of Girls Who Code to get more information.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Week 4</h4>
		<h5>Forbidden Island Reflection</h5>
		<p>I took charge by reading the rules out loud to my teammates. This seemed to steer us in the right direction, but Erin did speak up and say that she prefers to read the rules herself to make sure she understands. I’m glad she spoke up! It made me feel good to know that we can bring up issues and concerns early on in the game. When the game got started, I took less of a leadership role. Nat and Erin seemed to already have a strategy in mind, so I let them do their thing. This worked for me, since strategy isn’t my strength! I felt confident and calm during the game which seems like a good sign.</p>
		<p>Our team seemed to work really well together through the game! We started by reading all of the documentation together, out loud, making sure we understood the rules. I think we all are aware of others’ thoughts and feelings, which is good, but I do think it can be detrimental if nobody steps up to make decisions when they need to be made. I will keep this in mind as we move through the Capstone projects.</p>
		<h5>Weekly Reflection</h5>
		<p>We got assigned our capstone groups this week and I couldn't be more excited. Thus far we have gotten to know one another on a more personal level and gotten some good work done. I'm optimistic about the rest of our time working together. Personally I feel like I'm in a good place in the bootcamp. I've been able to stay on top of the work and get ahead on a couple projects.</p>
		<p>This Week I...</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Went to a volunteer event and spoke with Roxanne Blair, a freelance business developer, about coming to Demo Day.</li>
			<li>Practiced my elevator pitch</li>
			<li>Got drinks with my capstone group!</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Week 5</h4>
		<p>Capstone projects are underway and moving along. George and Dylan said that our group is pretty far ahead of the game, but I think we are moving at a steady and comfortable pace. I may not completely understand the PHP syntax, but the overall concepts are coming together the more time I spend playing around with code.</p>
		<p>I realize that I can be headstrong while working amongst a team. I don't mind things moving quickly and pieces of the project coming together without my involvement. But sometimes that means other group members feel confused or left out of the process. I am working on being more inclusive and sensitive to other group members learning styles.</p>
		<p>Javascript was the most difficult concept for me this week. I know it is something that I will need to spend more time learning in order for the syntax to make sense. That being said, I tried my best with the Javascript Challenge and didn't get too down on myself for not being able to attempt the more difficult assignment tiers.</p>
		<p>Meeting with Karen was good. I appreciate her support and listening ear. After meeting with Dan I was left with a couple actionable tasks that I still need to complete, namely contacting a couple employees at various tech companies in Albuquerque. I've never done this before and it is somewhat out of my comfort zone, but I'm sure it won't be too bad.</p>
