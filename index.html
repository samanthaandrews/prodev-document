		<h3>How I Use My Whole Brain</h3>
		<p>I use my whole brain when I am creating. Whether it be writing blog posts, writing code, or designing, I am
			hitting all four quadrants. Even when I am writing creatively I am using the logical and analytical side of my
			brain because I want the flow and pacing of the writing to make sense to the reader.

			Coding also feels like I am using my whole brain. I get to be creative with the design, but there are limits
			since I want users (other humans) to be able to use my code. This means my design has to be user-friendly and
			logical. In addition, writing code that others will be able to understand means I have to use the
			organizational quadrant of my brain.

			Graphic design was my introduction to using my whole brain. I found that when I was designing and working with
			clients, I was completely immersed in the task at hand. Losing track of time is a clue that points to
			whole-brain activities.</p>

		<h3>Golden Circle</h3>
		<div>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Why?</strong>
				I believe everyone is creative and that believing in your own creative potential is a powerful tool to
				living a happy, healthy, fulfilling life. I want to build stronger, more creative communities.</li>
				<li><strong>How?</strong>
				Coding</li>
				<li><strong>What?</strong>
				Building human-centered apps and websites. I want to improve people’s lives by improving the technology that
				they use.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
		<h4>Version 1</h4>
		<p>Hi my name is Sam. I seek to improve people’s lives by improving the technology that they use. I build
			human-centered apps and websites that help individuals be more creative, productive, and happy. I’m learning
			full stack web development with the CNM STEMulus Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp, which focuses on the LAMP stack.
			How are you working within the community?</p>
		<h4>Version 2</h4>
		<p>This is the second version of my elevator pitch.</p>
		<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
		<h4>Week 1</h4>
		<p>I know I'm still very firmly in the honeymoon phase of this bootcamp, but I'm loving it thus far. I realize I
			am interested in both frontend and backend development. I seek to understand as much as possible about whatever
			we are learning and I like asking other students for help when I don't understand something. Everyone has their
			strengths and I appreciate being part of a team. I think the immersive, fast-paced environment fits my
			personality and learning style.</p>
